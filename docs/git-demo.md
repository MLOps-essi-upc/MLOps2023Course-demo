# Git demo for the MLOps 2023-24 course
In this demo we will see the main features of [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a version control system.

## Git installation
Git can be installed in different ways depending on the operating system. For example, in Ubuntu you can install it with
the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

## Git configuration
Once installed, we need to configure Git with our name and email. This is important because every Git commit uses this
information, and itâ€™s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:
```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john.doe@mail.com"
```

## Git initialization
To start using Git, we need to initialize a repository. This can be done with the following command:
```bash
git init
```
This will create a hidden folder called `.git` in the current directory. This folder contains all the information about the repository.
